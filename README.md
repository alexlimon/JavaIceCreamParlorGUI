This is an object-oriented project written in a Java SWING GUI based on an ice cream simulation where the user has the choice of created and updating workers,customers and icecreams. The orders are based on servings and actual money that each customer has, and the system keeps track of these and can be displayed for later use. A variety of representations of the data can be seen through pie and bar charts based on the customers happiness and money in the register (another component of the project). The actual interface can be seen through the mainframe class and it ported through a class called the shop which connects all the classes and math behind the simulation.
